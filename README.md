# TopWallpaper

A Simple Daily Wallpaper grabber.


This script can be run daily and will grab the top 5 posts off /r/wallpapers/
(Post number and sub used are easily configurable)
If you don't like the wallpaper grabbed for the day, this script has the top 5 wallpapers saved in a folder located in the same folder as the script, you can manually change it there.


I made it for myself because I like how the windows lock screen always has cool new wallpapers for me to see.

Follow the instructions in the python file
